# adaline implementation in rust

Relatively simple implementation of the adaptive linear neuron. Data needs to be in CSV format in [data/adaline.csv](data/adaline.csv) - I haven't included any data because the data I used comes from my university class, and I'm not sure about it's copyright.

## CSV Format

Needs to be:

 * -1 or 1 for which class the entry is in
 * x0
 * x1

Headers aren't necessary.
